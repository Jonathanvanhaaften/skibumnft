                        With skiing, you get to draw a line down the mountain however you see it,
                         so I’ve always related the two in terms of creativity. I can’t really pinpoint
                        a way to describe how I see the mountains, but one—being in the mountains—definitely influences the other—art.”</i>

                              <p>In 2018 Benchelter  made the jump from K2 to Atomic, able to have more control over his pro models
                                  he created one of the top rated skis with the eye-catching top sheet. Bringing Atomic onto the scene of Freestyle skiing. 
                                  "You can feel the influence of Mammoth Mountain, the mountain he grew up on, within his art and his love for the mountains." </p>

                    It starts with Chris and friends customizing the van with his art among some amazing features.
                     On the first stop we meet professional surfer Rob Mechado who shapes his own boards learning the impact of surf
                      culture on Benchetlers famous skis and art style. From there we head to the mountain Benchetler grew up on, Mammoth, 
                      which had record breaking snowfall for that January.  The short film continues north through Oregon and into Canada,
                     visiting Whistler, Tofino and finishing back in Whistler with some heli skiing.</p><br /></div>

                       Sunrise and sunset are always beautiful, and the jagged peaks, like the Minarets in my backyard, are always something 
                       I enjoy looking at. I live in a place that’s very multidimensional—I’m close to the coast and I love surfing,
                        so I tend to draw waves a lot, and the mountains are big and we also have amazing desert landscapes and rock climbing—so 
                        I just mix it all in. And then I’ve been fortunate enough to travel quite a bit, so I take inspiration from anywhere and
                         everywhere.”</i>

                      Chris’s style resembles his background in the sports of skiing, surfing and climbing. It marries the ocean's
                       flow, creating long deep strokes filled with earthy tones of the mountains, bringing in a brightness of 
                       the reddish hues from the sun that allows his work to pop. His distinct style has evolved over the years
                        from characters of old man winter into landscapes,but his signature style is still present in every work
                        .  Benchetler’s NFT drop is an animated acrylic painting on the very exclusive marketplace .
                          It embodies his classic style and tones, in a deep and inspiring genesis piece. 
              On his Instagram, he writes: <i> “Supporting community loss is a collective effort. We grieve the losses, present and past.
 This artwork honors our friends and heroes, and hopes to transcend grief by communing with spirit. “</i><br />

and the souls we’ve lost to them—combining elements that have driven my art since the beginning. 
This piece is a tribute to my mentors. Old Man Winter is the animating force behind my art and my life; representing my 
 father’s soul and spirit ever present in the mountains. The other faces, the eagle, the gift-bearing hands—each represents 
 an adventurer in whose tracks I follow, sometimes literally. The holes created by their loss can only be filled through
  celebration and remembrance. Supporting community loss is a collective effort. We grieve the losses, present and past.
   This artwork honors our friends and heroes, and hopes to transcend grief by communing with spirit. 
   If desired, the first collector will receive a few collectables from my personal archives—a pair of Limited-Edition
     hand signed Atomic x Grateful Dead skis I designed, and Limited-Edition Book/ Vinyl LP from Fire On The Mountain—a
      multifaceted past project and collaboration I did with the Grateful Dead.</i>

                         He brings a certain innovation, and has definitely influenced my work. With Chris entering the NFT space
                          it lends credibility to the future of ski NFT culture and Chris will hopefully bring with him a variety
                           of ski-style artists into the NFT community.</p>
